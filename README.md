# Awards Forum

Awards Forum is a discussion forum for entertainment industry awards prognostication, inspired by GoldDerby, that utilizes the MEN stack and created as an assignment for a General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp.

### Why I Chose This Application

When deciding on a project, I wanted an opportunity to relate my interests to the technologies use to create something functional, community-based, and multifaceted. Concurrent with Unit 2 of my General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp, being taugh from October to November in 2024, is the release of the bulk of films intended for awards consideration, sometimes referred to as "Oscar-bait". As a burgeoning cinephile, I actively seek out these films and analyze them for creative and technical accomplishments. GoldDerby is the predominant website for discussion and prognostication of United States-based entertainment awards, filled with users who similarly breakdown and discuss films based on their awards potential. It served as an execellent model for a project with two major applications: a forum for discussion (the MVP) and a prediction center (the level up content).

### How To Use

Awards Forum follows basic CRUD operations using RESTful routing conventions to allow authenticated-users the ability to create conversation topics and contribute to conversations. Any gues can read a thread, but only users can open new threads, edit or delete threads they have created, post comments, and edit or delete comment they have made.
